This is your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a string of round, curly, and square open and 
closing brackets, return whether the brackets are 
balanced (well-formed).

For example, given the string "([])[]({})", you should 
return true.

Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should 
return false.

Have a great day!
